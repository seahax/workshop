I've been a software engineer for over 20 years. Mostly, I do web development. Some frontend, some backend, some design, and a lot of architecture. I consider myself a code <d term="craftsperson" definition="A person who practices a trade or handicraft, focusing on skillful execution of a technique in order to achieve high quality results." />. I'm not a 10x developer because all the extra experience goes to doing it better, not doing it faster. As they say: Go slow to go fast.

Seahax is my little hack space. So named because I live in Seattle, love the sea, and this is not work. Everything I make here is for fun, and a little bit for my mental health. If it's published, then it's under the <a href="https://unlicense.org" text="Unlicense" />. Anything else might make it work! Feel free to use it in anyway you want. Reach out if you have questions or want to discuss something.
