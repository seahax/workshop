0.0.5

The first line of this file must be the version number. The Go Publish workflow
will create a tag for the version on the first line at the commit when this
file was last modified.

If the workflow fails before tagging due to a precondition not being met, then
you must make a new commit that includes a change to this file. You can either
bump the version number (possibly skipping versions), rebase and move the
version file change commit to the top, or just change a line in this file (eg.
"Updating commit for version 0.0.1").
